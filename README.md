## Overview
 This is my first ever coding project. It took me a while to finish this challenge  so please your opinion will be greatly valued. I could not create different versions for mobile and web. An advice on that will be helpful. In this project, I worked only with desktop view.  If you have any suggestions for improvements please guide me. Thanks.
